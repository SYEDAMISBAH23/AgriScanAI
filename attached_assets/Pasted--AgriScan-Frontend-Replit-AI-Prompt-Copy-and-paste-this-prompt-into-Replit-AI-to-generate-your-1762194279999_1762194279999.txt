## EXPECTED RESPONSE FORMAT FROM /infer_image:

```json
{
  "produce_label": "banana",
  "produce_confidence": 0.95,
  "model_organic_prediction": "organic",
  "model_organic_confidence": 0.85,
  "detected_plu": "94011",
  "plu_confidence": 0.9,
  "verdict": {
    "verdict": "ORGANIC",
    "verdict_confidence": 0.95,
    "match": "perfect_match",
    "reliability": "very_high",
    "reasoning": "✓ MATCH! Both model and PLU code (94011) confirm this is organic.",
    "recommendation": "✓ Certified organic (PLU: 94011). Minimal pesticide residue. Simple water rinse recommended."
  },
  "automatic_advice": "**Nutrition:** ... **Cleaning Tips:** ..."
}
```

## KEY PAGES DATA STRUCTURE:

**Scan History Item:**
```javascript
{
  id: timestamp,
  date: new Date().toLocaleString(),
  produce: "banana",
  verdict: "ORGANIC",
  confidence: 0.95,
  plu: "94011",
  fullData: { complete response from API }
}
```

**Fraud Report Item:**
```javascript
{
  id: timestamp,
  date: new Date().toLocaleString(),
  produce: "apple",
  plu: "4131",
  expected: "conventional",
  actual: "organic",
  severity: "high",
  status: "pending",
  description: "...",
  location: "..."
}
```

## TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS:

✅ Start with login page first
✅ Test API integration on home page
✅ Build history persistence next
✅ Style consistently with Tailwind
✅ Test on mobile
✅ Add error boundaries for API failures
✅ Use localStorage for offline functionality

Good luck! 🚀
```

## ALTERNATIVE: If Replit AI needs refinement:

If the first AI generation needs adjustments, use follow-up prompts:

**For styling issues:**
> "Improve the styling of the home page. Make the upload section more prominent with a drag-and-drop visualization. Use gradient backgrounds and better spacing."

**For missing features:**
> "Add a detailed fraud report statistics dashboard showing total reports, verified cases, and resolution rate charts."

**For API issues:**
> "Add comprehensive error handling for API timeouts, network failures, and invalid responses. Show user-friendly error messages and retry buttons."
